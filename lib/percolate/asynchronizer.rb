    # Arguments:
    # - file (String): The file to write.
    # - method_name (Symbol): The name of the Percolate method that wraps the
    #   command.
    # - margs_arraym (Array of Arrays): The arguments for each wrapper method
    #   call. Each element is an argument Array of a separate call.
    # - commands (Array of Strings): The commands to be executed. This and the
    #   args_array must be the same length.
