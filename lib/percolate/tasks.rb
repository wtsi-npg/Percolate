    include NamedTasks
    # Defines a synchronous external (system call) task method.
    #
    # Arguments:
    #
    # - margs (Array): The arguments that are necessary and sufficient to
    #   identify an invocation of the task. If the task method is called in
    #   multiple contexts with these same arguments, they will resolve to a
    #   single invocation in the Memoizer.
    # - command (String): A complete command line string to be executed.
    #
    # Other arguments (keys and values):
    #
    # - :pre (Proc): A precondition callback that must evaluate true before
    #   the task is executed. Optional.
    # - :post (Proc): A postcondition callback that must evaluate true before
    #   a result is returned. Optional.
    # - :result (Proc): A return value callback that must evaluate to the desired
    #   return value.
    # - :unwrap (boolean): A boolean indicating that the return value will be
    #   unwrapped.
    #
    #  These Procs may accept none, some, or all the arguments that are
    #  defined by margs. Each will be called with the  appropriate number.
    #  For example, if the :pre Proc has arity 2, it will be called with the
    #  first 2 elements of margs.
    #
    # Returns:
    # - Return value of the :result Proc, or nil.

    # Defines an asynchronous external (batch queue) task method.
    #
    # Arguments:
    #
    # - margs (Array): The arguments that are necessary and sufficient to
    #   identify an invocation of the task. If the task method is called in
    #   multiple contexts with these same arguments, they will resolve to a
    #   single invocation in the Memoizer.
    # - command (String): A complete command line string to be executed.
    # - work_dir (String): The working directory where the batch job will be run.
    # - log (String): The name of the batch queue log file. This may be an
    #   absolute file name, or one relative to the work_dir.
    #
    # Other arguments (keys and values):
    #
    # - :pre (Proc): A precondition callback that must evaluate true before
    #   the task is submitted to the batch queue system. Optional.
    # - :post (Proc): A postcondition callback that must evaluate true before
    #   a result is returned. Optional.
    # - :result (Proc): A return value callback that must evaluate to the desired
    #   return value.
    # - :unwrap (boolean): A boolean indicating that the return value will be
    #   unwrapped.
    # - :async (Hash): A mapping of batch queue system parameters to arguments.
    #   These are passed to the batch queue system only and changes to these must
    #   not affect the return value of the method.
    #

    # Defines an indexed array asynchronous external (batch queue) task method.
    #
    # Arguments:
    #
    # - margs_arrays (Array of Arrays): The argument arrays for each indexed
    #   method call. Each element is an argument Array of a separate call and
    #   contains the arguments that are necessary and sufficient to identify an
    #   invocation of the task. If the task method is called in  multiple contexts
    #   with these same arguments, they will resolve to a single invocation in the
    #   Memoizer.
    # - commands (Array of Strings): The command strings to be executed. This and
    #   the margs_arrays must be the same length.
    # - work_dir (String): The working directory where the batch job will be run.
    # - log (String): The name of the batch queue log file. This may be an
    #   absolute file name, or one relative to the work_dir.
